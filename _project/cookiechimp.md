I spent summer 2024 as a Software Engineering Intern at CookieChimp, a modern cookie consent platform. It was a great experience getting to work on real-world privacy compliance tools.

One of my main projects was developing an automated test suite for GDPR and CCPA consent banners using Capybara with Selenium. Making sure these banners work properly and handle consent data accurately is super important since companies rely on them for legal compliance.

I also built a user onboarding survey to help the team better understand their users' demographics and behavior patterns. The cool part was integrating it with Slack API so survey results would automatically get sent to the onboarding channel, helping the team to stay on top of new user insights.

Another feature I worked on was a timeframe filter for displaying user consent data. Users could select different time periods and the system would dynamically group the data by day, month, or year depending on what made sense for that timeframe. I used Tailwind UI to make sure it looked clean and worked well on different screen sizes.
