Hi, I'm Joshua Kannappilly, an electrical engineering student at the University of Notre Dame. I'm passionate about the intersection of hardware and software, with specific interests in PCB design, embedded systems, space technology, and semiconductors. I'm currently seeking a Summer 2026 internship to apply my skills in a real-world setting. In my free time, you can find me playing football, practicing piano, or working on my Spanish.
